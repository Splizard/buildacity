You are hereby granted a universal non-exclusive right to, use, reproduce, 
make available, feature, modify, display, perform, distribute, and/or 
otherwise exploit This Project for *any purpose* subject to the 
following conditions:
      
1. If any third party interacts with, receives, or observes, the display, 
   feature, performance and/or otherwise availability of your copies of 
   This Project, then You must ensure that The Source Code and Dependencies 
   of those copies are Readibly Obtainable and Clearly Discoverable, by those 
   third-parties for at least 30 days after you last displayed, featured, 
   performed and/or otherwise made your copy available.      
   
2. You may not restrict in any way, the rights that This License grants to 
   any users or Providers of The Project (except when they have made an 
   unresolved breach to the terms and conditions of This License). You agree:  
   
   (a) not to sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek damages from, in 
       order to prevent or punish, any user or Providers, for 
       exercising their rights to This Project (including to any 
       Modifications You have made).
  
   (b) to irrevocably and automatically grant the required licenses 
       (including patent licenses), at no cost, fee, nor royalty to every 
       Provider and/or user of This Project so that they may 
       exercise their rights to any Modifications You have made).

   (c) not to obfuscate, omit, or obstruct in any way This License and/or 
       the Buildable Source of This Project and/or the ability for a 
       third party to find, acquire and/or obtain it, either in bad faith, 
       and/or to circumvent the terms and conditions of This License.

3. When making Modifications to This Project You must decide whether or 
   not to become/remain a "Provider" and either:
   
   (a) You agree to become/remain a Provider. You must maintain Your Notice
       in The Attached Notices and for at least 30 days and as long as you 
       continue to offer any Derived Products, you must ensure the Buildable 
       Source for Your Derived Products are, Readibly Obtainable and 
       Clearly Discoverable, by the public.

   (b) You do not agree to become/remain a Provider and you omit/remove Your 
       Notice from The Attached Notices and you agree that This Project 
       (including any of Your Modifications) may be relicensed upon the 
       written agreement between each Provider under the terms of an agreed 
       upon Open Source License (or at any time if there are no Providers). 

4. You may not invalidate the Attached Notices through any of Your 
   Modifications and the only permitted modifications You can make to the 
   Attached Notices are to:

   (a) Add/modify/remove your Notice.

   (b) Reorder the Notices.  

   (c) Remove a Notice from your copy of This Project with the written 
       consent of the copyright holder.

   (d) Merge Notices verbatim with another set of Notices. Each Community 
       Trademark before the merge must remain a Community Trademark after
       the merge. You must make a reasonable effort to research and resolve 
       conflicts by awarding trademarks to the Trademark Owner (to your best 
       judgement). A trademark must not be removed from the Attached Notices
       this way.

5. You may not use the name of any (other) Providers nor any of their 
   Community Trademarks, to title, endorse or promote, any products, 
   projects, works, performances and/or services derived from, or otherwise 
   featuring This Project unless You have the prior written consent from, 
   or the publicly documented permission from the Provider.

   However this condition cannot (and does not) prevent You from:

   (a) "Descriptive Fair Use" which means using dictionary words to 
       promote products, projects, works, performances and/or services, 
       derived from, and/or otherwise featuring This Project as long as 
       those words are used in good faith and for their natural meanings 
       and are not used in an attempt to capitalise on the reference to 
       any (other) Provider's Community Trademarks.

   (b) "Nominative Fair Use" which means using a Provider's Community 
       Trademark to review and/or draw comparison to Derived Products.

   (c) "Contributing" which means that as long as your copy is a 
        Contribution you are not required to remove any Community 
        Trademarks that already exist in The Project (as you received it).
       
In the event that You breach a condition of This License, You must take 
immediate steps to resolve this breach and, until You resolve this breach, 
any rights granted to You by This License (except for the rights to display 
and distribute The Buildable Source and Dependencies) are automatically 
terminated, however, the conditions of This License will continue to apply to 
You and any third party who has agreed to This License, may, on behalf of 
each copyright holder, and only in good faith and to ensure the fairness, 
integrity, precedent and/or compliance of This License, contact, sue, 
litigate against and/or otherwise seek and collect damages from You.

   (a) "Platform Provided Works", which means any work that is provided by a 
        third party Platform or its owner (including but not limited to, the

        be Operated on that Platform.

   (b) "Platform Protected Work", which means any part of This Project that is 
        protected from disclosure or distribution because of an agreement with
        the owner of a third party Platform, such that this part of the work 
        only serves to implement a low-level, general and/or otherwise 
        standard interface, in order to enable The Project to be Operated on 
        that Platform.

   (c) "Mods or Larger Projects", which means any larger work where the 
        preferred form of making changes to that work are kept external and 
        separate from The Source Code and where that work depends upon and/or 
        embeds This Project in such a way that This Project (including any of 
        Your Modifications) can be meaningfully separated from the Larger Work 
        and This Project can continue to function and remain useful for its 
        intended purpose without any additional modifications.

"Notice" means a copyright notice listed in The Attached Notices that
 is preceded by zero or more comma-separated trademarks and precedes zero 
 or more comma separated identities (such as an Email Address or Domain).
 Each trademark is associated with the copyright holder that added that 
 copyright notice (it is theirs), and each trademark added this way is 
 considered to be a "Community Trademark" when:

   (a) It is the appropriate legal representation of a trademark, or is a 
       term or phrase followed by, the unicode trademark symbol, '(TM)' 
       or '(R)', and

   (b) It is unique and "Distinguishable" (a reasonable person will not 
       confuse the trademark with an earlier Provider's Community 
       Trademark).

   (c) It was added in good faith and represents a genuine mark to 
       be used for a Derived Product.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THIS PROJECT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER

AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE 
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

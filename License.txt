    (a) the addition of a Notice to record Your agreement to become a
        Publisher for This Project, which means that You agree to,

    (a) "Descriptive Fair Use", which means use of dictionary words 
        within, or to promote Dependant Projects such that these words

        Publisher's Community Trademark.

        within a Notice, to refer to, document the usage of, or to 
        review and/or fairly draw comparison to an Official Release as 
        long as any distinction between the Official Release and any 
        Dependant Projects is clear and this use is not featured in

        ie. in primary promotional material, titles, or taglines.

    (c) "Contributive Fair Use", which means use of a Publisher's 
        Community Trademark, verbatim, on a Community Contribution 
        Channel where such use is the result of copying The Buildable

immediate steps to resolve this breach and until You resolve this breach, 
any rights granted to You by This License (except for the rights to
